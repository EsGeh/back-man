# back-man

Experimental command line utility for managing backup tasks based on config files.
This script is implemented as a wrapper around the `ct-backup.fish` command from [copy-tools](https://github.com/EsGeh/copy-tools) and has a very similar command line interface.

Work in progress. Use at your own risk.
Feedback welcome.
